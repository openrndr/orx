# orx-rabbit-control

`orx-rabbit-control` uses `orx-parameters` annotations to generate a control interface, just like `orx-gui`. It can be used as an alternative to `orx-gui` when you want to control your OPENRNDR program from a mobile device or a different computer.

### Using the web client

Go to [rabbitcontrol.github.io/client](https://rabbitcontrol.github.io/client/) and enter your IP-address and port. 

_Note: there are currently issues with the insecure websocket connection that RabbitControl uses and some browsers (like mobile Safari), we're looking for solutions..._
