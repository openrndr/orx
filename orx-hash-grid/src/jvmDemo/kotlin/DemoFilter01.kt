/** A demo to generate and display filtered random points.
 *
 * The program performs the following steps:
 * - Generates 10,000 random points uniformly distributed within the drawable bounds.
 * - Filters the generated points to enforce a minimum distance of 20.0 units between them.
 * - Visualizes the filtered points as circles with a radius of 10.0 units on the canvas.
