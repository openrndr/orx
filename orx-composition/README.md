# orx-composition

Shape composition library

One can think of a Composition as a vector design made out of primitives
like ShapeContour, Shape, or LineSegment, each having its fill color,
stroke color and stroke weight.

Compositions can be loaded from SVG files and then queried or altered via code.

Composition can also be generated from scratch, typically using `drawComposition { ... }`, then saved as an SVG file.

Read about Composition [in the guide](https://guide.openrndr.org/drawing/drawingSVG.html).

_The code in `orx-composition` was previously found under `openrndr-draw` in the `openrndr` repository._

## Demos
### DemoCompositionDrawer01

Demonstrates how to

- Create a Composition
- Draw it on the program window
- Save it to an SVG file
- Print the SVG content as text

### DemoCompositionDrawer02

Demonstrates how to draw a Composition and how to use
`ClipMode.REVERSE_DIFFERENCE` to clip shapes.

The first shape clips part of the second one away,
producing a shape that seems to be behind the first one.

Without clipping, the second circle would cover part of the first one.

### DemoCompositionDrawer03

Draws a composition using 3 circles and `ClipMode.REVERSE_DIFFERENCE`.

A println() demonstrates that the result contains 3 shapes:
a complete circle, a moon-like shape, and a shape with two small black areas.

One way to verify this is by saving the design as an SVG file and opening
it in vector editing software.

### DemoCompositionDrawer04

Demonstrates how to add content to and how to clear an existing Composition.

A number of circles are added when the program starts.
Dragging the mouse button adds more circles.
Right-clicking the mouse clears the Composition.

### DemoCompositionDrawer05

Demonstrates how to

- Create a Composition with a group
- Add XML attributes so the group appears as a layer in Inkscape
