# Developer notes

## Publish and use local builds of the library in your applications

First, build and publish [OPENRNDR](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr) to the local maven repository:

Run (or import in IntelliJ IDEA and edit the run configuration).
```sh
# In openrndr repository
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal snapshot
``` 

This command will build and publish a snapshot of the next version of the library. For example, if the current latest
release is 0.4.2, then it will create a release named "0.4.3-SNAPSHOT" and publish it to your local maven repository.
The exact version will be shown in the console output during the build process.

Now you can run the same command again but for this repository. 

```sh
# In orx repository
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal snapshot
``` 

It will automatically use the locally published snapshot of OPENRNDR for building ORX and will publish ORX to your local
maven repository with the same logic as before.

Once that's done, you can use the local build of ORX in
your [openrndr-template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template) by specifying the version you published. In this
case, it would be "0.4.3-SNAPSHOT".
