| [`orx-temporal-blur`](orx-temporal-blur/) | Post-processing temporal-blur video effect. CPU intense, therefore not intended  for use with the `ScreenRecorder` extension or other real-time uses. |
| [`orx-time-operators`](orx-time-operators/) | A collection of time-sensitive functions aimed at controlling raw data over-time,  such as Envelope and LFO. |
| [`orx-timer`](orx-timer/) | Simple timer functionality providing `repeat`, to run code with a given interval and `timeOut`, to run code once after a given delay. |

## JVM only

# Developer notes

## Create and use local builds of the library

run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Prelease.version=0.4.0-SNAPSHOT` (or import in IntelliJ IDEA and edit the run configuration)

In an [`openrndr-template`](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template) based project set `orxUseSnapshot = true` in order to use the snapshot build.
