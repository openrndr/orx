# orx-quadtree

An extension for creating a [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) for points. A quadtree is a spatial
partioning tree structure meant to provide fast spatial queries such as nearest points within a range.

## Example

```kotlin
val box = Rectangle.fromCenter(Vector2(400.0), 750.0)

val quadTree = Quadtree<Vector2>(box) { it }

for (point in points) {
    quadTree.insert(point)
}

val nearestQuery = quadTree.nearest(points[4], 20.0)
```
