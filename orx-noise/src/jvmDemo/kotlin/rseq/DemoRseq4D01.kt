/**
 * Demo that presents a 3D visualization of points distributed using a 4D quasirandom sequence (R4).
 * Each point is represented as a sphere with its position and color derived from the sequence values.
 *
 * This function performs the following tasks:
 * - Initializes a 3D camera for orbital navigation of the scene.
 * - Generates 10,000 points in 4D space using the `rSeq4D` function. The points are scaled
 *   and transformed into 3D positions with an additional w-coordinate for color variation.
 * - Creates a reusable sphere mesh for rendering.
 * - Renders each point as a sphere with its position determined by the 3D coordinates
 *   of the point and its color calculated by shifting the hue of a base color using
 *   the w-coordinate value.
