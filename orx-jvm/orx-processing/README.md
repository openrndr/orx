# orx-processing

orx-processing is a module designed to facilitate seamless type conversions
between Processing's types and OPENRNDR's types. It provides utilities and
methods that allow developers to integrate the two graphics frameworks
effectively by bridging the gap between their respective data structures.

For example, orx-processing enables you to:
 - Convert Processing's PVector to OPENRNDR's Vector2 or Vector3.
 - Transform OPENRNDR Shape and ShapeContour into their Processing equivalents.
 
This module is particularly useful in projects that require the features or
APIs of both Processing and OPENRNDR, simplifying interoperability and reducing boilerplate code for type translation.
