/**
 * Entry point of a graphical application that demonstrates the use of color matrix
 * transformations on an image displayed within a grid layout.
 *
 * Overview:
 * - Initializes a window with a resolution of 720x720 pixels.
 * - Loads an image from the specified file path.
 * - Splits the drawing canvas into a 7x1 grid of cells.
 * - In each grid cell, applies custom grayscale transformations to the image using
 *   a color matrix. The grayscale transformation coefficients for red, green, and blue
 *   channels are computed based on the index of the grid cell.
 * - Displays the adjusted image in each grid cell with horizontal alignment modifications
 *   to position the images dynamically based on their index within the grid.
