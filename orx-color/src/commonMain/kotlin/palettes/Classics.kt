/**
 * Generates an analogous color palette based on the current color.

 * This function creates a sequence of colors by shifting the hue of the current color
 * gradually across a specified range of steps, using a particular color model that supports hue shifting.
 *
 * @param T The color model used for hue shifting.
 *          Must extend both `HueShiftableColor` and `ColorModel`.
 * @param hueShift The total degree shift in hue between the first color and the last color.
 *                 The hue shift is divided among the specified number of steps.
 * @param steps The number of colors to include in the palette, including the starting color.
 *              Defaults to 5.
 * @return A list of `ColorRGBa` instances forming the analogous palette.

/**
 * Generates a split complementary color palette based on the current `ColorRGBa`.

 *
 * @param T The color model and hue shifting capability of the colors to generate.
 * @param splitFactor A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls the spread of the complementary colors
 *                    around the complementary hue. A higher value increases the angle between
 *                    the colors on the hue wheel, while a lower value decreases it.
 * @param double If `true`, the method will generate two additional colors derived by more granular
 *               shifts within the complementary range. If `false`, a simpler complementary palette
 *               is returned.
