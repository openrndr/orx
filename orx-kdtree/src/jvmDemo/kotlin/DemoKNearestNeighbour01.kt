/**
 * This demo initializes an interactive graphical application where 1000 randomly distributed points
 * are displayed on a 2D canvas. A KD-tree structure is used for spatial querying of the points, enabling
 * efficient nearest-neighbor searches based on the user's cursor position. The closest 7 points to the
 * cursor are highlighted with circles and lines connecting them to the cursor.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Generates 1000 random 2D points within the canvas.
 * - Builds a KD-tree from the list of points for optimized spatial querying.
 * - Visualizes the points and highlights the 7 nearest neighbors to the user's cursor position dynamically.
 * - Highlights include red-colored circles around the nearest points and red lines connecting them to the cursor.
