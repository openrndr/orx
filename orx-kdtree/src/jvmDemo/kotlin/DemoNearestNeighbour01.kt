/**
 * Initializes an interactive graphical application that displays 1000 randomly distributed 2D points.
 * The points are organized into a KD-tree for efficient spatial querying.
 *
 * Key functionality:
 * - Displays the points as small circles on the canvas.
 * - Dynamically highlights the nearest point to the cursor's position by drawing a larger circle around it.
 *
 * Highlights:
 * - KD-tree structure enables efficient nearest-neighbor searches.
 * - The nearest point to the cursor is determined and visually emphasized in real-time as the cursor moves.
